# MakeUC-2023
MakeUC 2023 Hackathon Project


This tool was made with python 3.11.6, please ensure you are using it when you try to run this application for best results

All packages and their versions used can be found in the requirements.txt file you *could* download them one by one *or* you could run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them in bulk

The AI summaries in this tool were made with the mistral-7b-instruct-v0.1.Q4_0 model weights which can be found [here](https://gpt4all.io/index.html)

Our recommendation is to use a python virtual environment when installing packages so you do not clutter your global package space.

Made with ❤️ at the 2023 Make UC Hackathon

This bill proposes changes to Ohio's property tax laws for homestead exemptions, disabled veterans, public service officers killed in the line of duty, and surviving spouses. The bill would increase income qualifications for the homestead exemption, reduce real property taxes on eligible individuals, and adjust total income thresholds and reduction amounts for disabled veterans' taxes. Additionally, the bill outlines reductions in taxes due to conviction of certain crimes and provides a tax reduction for surviving spouses of public service officers killed in the line of duty. Sections 323.152 and 4503.065 of the Revised Code would be repealed, and this bill applies to tax year 2023 and every subsequent year

Sec. 4713.50. (A) A tanning facility operator or employee

the facility's sun lamp tanning services unless both of the
following apply:
(a) The tanning facility operator or employee obtains the
consent of a parent or legal guardian of the individual prior to
each session of the use of the facility's sun lamp tanning
services. The consent shall be evidenced by the signature of the
parent or legal guardian on the form developed by the board
under section 4713.51 of the Revised Code. The form must be
signed in the presence of the operator or an employee of the
tanning facility.
(b) A parent or legal guardian of the individual is
present at the tanning facility for the duration of each session

Sec. 4713.51. The state cosmetology and barber board shall
develop a form for use by tanning facility operators and
employees in complying with the consent requirements of division
(B) (C) of section 4713.50 of the Revised Code. The form must

Sec. 4713.64. (A) The state cosmetology and barber board
may take disciplinary action under this chapter for any of the
following:
(1) Failure to comply with the safety, sanitation, and
licensing requirements of this chapter or rules adopted under

courses.
(C)(1) Except as provided in divisions (C)(2) and (3) of

(2) The board may take disciplinary action without

the disciplinary action of the right to request a hearing under
Chapter 119. of the Revised Code.
(3) In lieu of an adjudication, the board may enter into a
consent agreement with the holder of a license, permit, or
registration issued under this chapter. A consent agreement that
is ratified by a majority vote of a quorum of the board members
is considered to constitute the findings and orders of the board
with respect to the matter addressed in the agreement. If the
board does not ratify a consent agreement, the admissions and
findings contained in the agreement are of no effect, and the
case shall be scheduled for adjudication under Chapter 119. of
the Revised Code.
(D) The amount and content of corrective action courses
and other relevant criteria shall be established by the board in
rules adopted under section 4713.08 of the Revised Code.
(E)(1) The board may impose a separate fine for each
offense listed in division (A) of this section. The amount of
the first fine issued for a violation as the result of an
inspection shall be not more than two hundred fifty dollars if
the violator has not previously been fined for that offense. Any
fines issued for additional violations during such an inspection
shall not be more than one hundred dollars for each additional
violation. The fine shall be not more than five hundred dollars
if the violator has been fined for the same offense once before.
Any fines issued for additional violations during a second
inspection shall not be more than two hundred dollars for each
additional violation. The fine shall be not more than one
thousand dollars if the violator has been fined for the same
offense two or more times before. Any fines issued for
additional violations during a third inspection shall not be
more than three hundred dollars for each additional violation.
(2) The board shall issue an order notifying a violator of
a fine imposed under division (E)(1) of this section. The notice
shall specify the date by which the fine is to be paid. The date
shall be less than forty-five days after the board issues the
order.
(3) At the request of a violator who is temporarily unable
to pay a fine, or upon its own motion, the board may extend the
time period within which the violator shall pay the fine up to
ninety days after the date the board issues the order.
(4) If a violator fails to pay a fine by the date
specified in the board's order and does not request an extension
within ten days after the date the board issues the order, or if
the violator fails to pay the fine within the extended time
period as described in division (E)(3) of this section, the
board shall add to the fine an additional penalty equal to ten
per cent of the fine.
(5) If a violator fails to pay a fine within ninety days
after the board issues the order, the board shall add to the
fine interest at a rate specified by the board in rules adopted
under section 4713.08 of the Revised Code.
(6) If the fine, including any interest or additional
penalty, remains unpaid on the ninety-first day after the board
issues an order under division (E)(2) of this section, the
amount of the fine and any interest or additional penalty shall
be certified to the attorney general for collection in the form
and manner prescribed by the attorney general. The attorney
general may assess the collection cost to the amount certified
in such a manner and amount as prescribed by the attorney
general.
(F) In the case of an offense of failure to comply with
division (A) or (B)(2) or (3) of section 4713.50 of the Revised
Code, the board shall impose a fine of five hundred dollars if
the violator has not previously been fined for that offense. If
the violator has previously been fined for the offense, the
board may impose a fine in accordance with this division or take
another action in accordance with division (B) of this section.
(G) The board shall notify a licensee or registrant who is
in violation of division (A) of this section and the owner of
the salon in which the conditions constituting the violation
were found. The individual receiving the notice of violation and
the owner of the salon may request a hearing pursuant to section
119.07 of the Revised Code. If the individual or owner fails to
request a hearing or enter into a consent agreement thirty days
after the date the board, in accordance with section 119.07 of
the Revised Code and division (J) of this section, notifies the
individual or owner of the board's intent to act against the
individual or owner under division (A) of this section, the
board by a majority vote of a quorum of the board members may
take the action against the individual or owner without holding
an adjudication hearing.
(H) The board, after a hearing in accordance with Chapter
119. of the Revised Code or pursuant to a consent agreement, may
suspend a license, permit, or registration if the licensee,
permit holder, or registrant fails to correct an unsafe
condition that exists in violation of the board's rules or fails
to cooperate in an inspection. If a violation of this chapter or
rules adopted under it has resulted in a condition reasonably
believed by an inspector to create an immediate danger to the
health and safety of any individual using the facility, the
inspector may suspend the license or permit of the facility or
the individual responsible for the violation without a prior
hearing until the condition is corrected or until a hearing in
accordance with Chapter 119. of the Revised Code is held or a
consent agreement is entered into and the board either upholds
the suspension or reinstates the license, permit, or
registration.
(I) The board shall not take disciplinary action against
an individual licensed to operate a salon or school of
cosmetology for a violation of this chapter that was committed
by an individual licensed to practice a branch of cosmetology,
while practicing within the salon or school, when the
individual's actions were beyond the control of the salon owner
or school.
(J) In addition to the methods of notification required
under section 119.07 of the Revised Code, the board may send the
notices required under divisions (C)(2), (E)(2), and (G) of this
section by any delivery method that is traceable and requires
that the delivery person obtain a signature to verify that the
notice has been delivered. The board also may send the notices
by electronic mail, provided that the electronic mail delivery
system certifies that a notice has been received.
Section 2. That existing sections 4713.50, 4713.51, and
4713.64 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed.

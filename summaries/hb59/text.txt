residential premises with the consent of the tenant previously
has or presently is engaged in a violation as described in
division (A)(6)(a)(i) of section 1923.02 of the Revised Code,
the landlord shall terminate the week-to-week tenancy, month-to-

division (A)(6)(a)(i) of section 1923.02 of the Revised Code. If
the tenant fails to vacate the premises within three days after
the giving of that notice, then the landlord promptly shall
comply with division (A)(9) of section 5321.04 of the Revised

This bill requires a plaintiff in a tort action alleging an asbestos claim to file specified disclosures within thirty days of filing any complaint. The disclosures must include specific information about the exposed person's work history, employers, and exposure to asbestos-containing products. If a defendant files a motion under division (E)(1) of this section, the plaintiff must respond within 30 days or their claim will be administratively dismissed. Additionally, if a plaintiff fails to comply with disclosure requirements in division (B), their claim will also be administratively dismissed. This section applies to tort actions alleging an asbestos claim that are filed on or after the effective date and does not apply to claims for workers' compensation or veterans' benefits.

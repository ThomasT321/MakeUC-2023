To amend sections 2307.601, 2901.05, and 2901.09 of
the Revised Code to limit the locations at which
a person has no duty to retreat.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That sections 2307.601, 2901.05, and 2901.09 of
the Revised Code be amended to read as follows:
Sec. 2307.601. (A) As used in this section:
(1) "Residence" has and "vehicle" have the same meaning
meanings as in section 2901.05 of the Revised Code.
(2) "Tort action" has the same meaning as in section
2307.60 of the Revised Code.
(B) For purposes of determining the potential liability of
a person in a tort action related to the person's use of force
alleged to be in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of
the person's residence, if the person lawfully is in that
person's residence, the person has no duty to retreat before
using force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person's residence, and, if the person lawfully is an
occupant of that person person's vehicle or lawfully is an
occupant in a place in which vehicle owned by an immediate
family member of the person lawfully, the person has a right no
duty to be retreat before using force in self-defense or defense
of another.
(C) A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of
retreat as a factor in determining whether or not a person who
used force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person's residence reasonably believed that the force was
necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or safety.
Sec. 2901.05. (A) Every person accused of an offense is
presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,
and the burden of proof for all elements of the offense is upon
the prosecution. The burden of going forward with the evidence
of an affirmative defense, and the burden of proof, by a
preponderance of the evidence, for an affirmative defense other
than self-defense, defense of another, or defense of the
accused's residence presented as described in division (B)(1) of
this section, is upon the accused.
(B)(1) A person is allowed to act in self-defense, defense
of another, or defense of that person's residence. If, at the
trial of a person who is accused of an offense that involved the
person's use of force against another, there is evidence
presented that tends to support that the accused person used the
force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that
person's residence, the prosecution must prove beyond a
reasonable doubt that the accused person did not use the force
in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's
residence, as the case may be.
(2) Subject to division (B)(3) of this section, a person
is presumed to have acted in self-defense or defense of another
when using defensive force that is intended or likely to cause
death or great bodily harm to another if the person against whom
the defensive force is used is in the process of unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entering, or has unlawfully and
without privilege to do so entered, the residence or vehicle
occupied by the person using the defensive force.
(3) The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this
section does not apply if either of the following is true:
(a) The person against whom the defensive force is used
has a right to be in, or is a lawful resident of, the residence
or vehicle.
(b) The person who uses the defensive force uses it while
in a residence or vehicle and the person is unlawfully, and
without privilege to be, in that residence or vehicle.
(4) The presumption set forth in division (B)(2) of this
section is a rebuttable presumption and may be rebutted by a
preponderance of the evidence, provided that the prosecution's
burden of proof remains proof beyond a reasonable doubt as
described in divisions (A) and (B)(1) of this section.
(C) As part of its charge to the jury in a criminal case,
the court shall read the definitions of "reasonable doubt" and
"proof beyond a reasonable doubt," contained in division (E) of
this section.
(D) As used in this section:
(1) An "affirmative defense" is either of the following:
(a) A defense expressly designated as affirmative;
(b) A defense involving an excuse or justification
peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused, on which the
accused can fairly be required to adduce supporting evidence.
(2) "Dwelling" means a building or conveyance of any kind
that has a roof over it and that is designed to be occupied by
people lodging in the building or conveyance at night,
regardless of whether the building or conveyance is temporary or
permanent or is mobile or immobile. As used in this division, a
building or conveyance includes, but is not limited to, an
attached porch, and a building or conveyance with a roof over it
includes, but is not limited to, a tent.
(3) "Residence" means a dwelling in which a person resides
either temporarily or permanently or is visiting as a guest.
(4) "Vehicle" means a conveyance of any kind, whether or
not motorized, that is designed to transport people or property.
(E) "Reasonable doubt" is present when the jurors, after
they have carefully considered and compared all the evidence,
cannot say they are firmly convinced of the truth of the charge.
It is a doubt based on reason and common sense. Reasonable doubt
is not mere possible doubt, because everything relating to human
affairs or depending on moral evidence is open to some possible
or imaginary doubt. "Proof beyond a reasonable doubt" is proof
of such character that an ordinary person would be willing to
rely and act upon it in the most important of the person's own
affairs.
Sec. 2901.09. (A) As used in this section, "residence" has
and "vehicle" have the same meaning meanings as in section
2901.05 of the Revised Code.
(B) For purposes of any section of the Revised Code that
sets forth a criminal offense, a person who lawfully is in that
person's residence has no duty to retreat before using force in
self-defense, defense of another, or defense of that person's
residence if, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person person's vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a
place in which vehicle owned by an immediate family member of
the person lawfully has a right no duty to beretreat before
using force in self-defense or defense of another.
(C) A trier of fact shall not consider the possibility of
retreat as a factor in determining whether or not a person who
used force in self-defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person's residence reasonably believed that the force was
necessary to prevent injury, loss, or risk to life or safety.
Section 2. That existing sections 2307.601, 2901.05, and
2901.09 of the Revised Code are hereby repealed.

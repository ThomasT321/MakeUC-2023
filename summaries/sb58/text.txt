To amend section 9.68 of the Revised Code to
prohibit requiring fees or firearms liability
insurance for the possession of firearms, or
fees for the possession of knives.
BE IT ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE STATE OF OHIO:
Section 1. That section 9.68 of the Revised Code be
amended to read as follows:
Sec. 9.68. (A) The individual right to keep and bear arms,
being a fundamental individual right that predates the United
States Constitution and Ohio Constitution, and being a
constitutionally protected right in every part of Ohio, the
general assembly finds the need to provide uniform laws
throughout the state regulating the ownership, possession,
purchase, other acquisition, transport, storage, carrying, sale,
other transfer, manufacture, taxation, keeping, and reporting of
loss or theft of firearms, their components, and their
ammunition, and knives. The general assembly also finds and
declares that it is proper for law-abiding people to protect
themselves, their families, and others from intruders and
attackers without fear of prosecution or civil action for acting
in defense of themselves or others. Except as specifically
provided by the United States Constitution, Ohio Constitution,
state law, or federal law, a person, without further license,
permission, restriction, delay, or process, including by any
ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice, or other
action or any threat of citation, prosecution, or other legal
process, may own, possess, purchase, acquire, transport, store,
carry, sell, transfer, manufacture, or keep any firearm, part of
a firearm, its components, and its ammunition, and any knife,
without being required to have firearm liability insurance, and
without being required to pay a fee for the possession of a
firearm, part of a firearm, its components, its ammunition, or a
knife. Any such further license, permission, restriction, delay,
or process interferes with the fundamental individual right
described in this division and unduly inhibits law-abiding
people from protecting themselves, their families, and others
from intruders and attackers and from other legitimate uses of
constitutionally protected arms, including hunting and sporting
activities, and the state by this section preempts, supersedes,
and declares null and void any such further license, permission,
restriction, delay, or process.
(B) A person, group, or entity adversely affected by any
manner of ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice, or
other action enacted or enforced by a political subdivision in
conflict with division (A) of this section may bring a civil
action against the political subdivision seeking damages from
the political subdivision, declaratory relief, injunctive
relief, or a combination of those remedies. Any damages awarded
shall be awarded against, and paid by, the political
subdivision. In addition to any actual damages awarded against
the political subdivision and other relief provided with respect
to such an action, the court shall award reasonable expenses to
any person, group, or entity that brings the action, to be paid
by the political subdivision, if either of the following
applies:
(1) The person, group, or entity prevails in a challenge
to the ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice, or
action as being in conflict with division (A) of this section.
(2) The ordinance, rule, regulation, resolution, practice,
or action or the manner of its enforcement is repealed or
rescinded after the civil action was filed but prior to a final
court determination of the action.
(C) As used in this section:
(1) The possession, transporting, or carrying of firearms,
their components, their ammunition, or knives include, but are
not limited to, the possession, transporting, or carrying,
openly or concealed on a person's person or concealed ready at
hand, of firearms, their components, their ammunition, or
knives.
(2) "Firearm" has the same meaning as in section 2923.11
of the Revised Code.
(3) "Reasonable expenses" include, but are not limited to,
reasonable attorney's fees, court costs, expert witness fees,
and compensation for loss of income.
(4) "Knife" means a cutting instrument and includes a
sharpened or pointed blade.
(5) "Arms" includes firearms and knives.
(6) "Firearm liability insurance" means a policy of
liability insurance covering losses resulting from the use of a
firearm owned by the person covered by the policy.
(D) This section does not apply to either of the
following:
(1) A zoning ordinance that regulates or prohibits the
commercial sale of knives, firearms, firearm components, or
ammunition for firearms in areas zoned for residential or
agricultural uses;
(2) A zoning ordinance that specifies the hours of
operation or the geographic areas where the commercial sale of
knives, firearms, firearm components, or ammunition for firearms
may occur, provided that the zoning ordinance is consistent with
zoning ordinances for other retail establishments in the same
geographic area and does not result in a de facto prohibition of
the commercial sale of knives, firearms, firearm components, or
ammunition for firearms in areas zoned for commercial, retail,
or industrial uses.
Section 2. That existing section 9.68 of the Revised Code
is hereby repealed.
